# Advent Of Code 2022

My solutions for advent of Code 2022,
I probably will not have the time to finish all of them this year,
but I'll try regardless :D

## How to run

You can run all the solutions with your inputs by adding
a `Config.kt` Object and specifying it like so.

```kotlin
object Config {
    const val session: String = "your session token"
}
```
